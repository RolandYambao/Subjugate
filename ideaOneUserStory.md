# Project 2 Idea #1: Strategy Game Faction Database
This project is a database containing the units, buildings, and support powers of a, or multiple, faction(s) for a fictional strategy game. There would be three models, one for units, one for buildings, and one for support powers, each addition detailing the various traits of each. 

## Who
This project is designed to be usable for gamers who play a hypothetical strategy game, looking for the traits of a specific faction of their choosing.

## What
Upon entering the website, there is a login requirement, once one successfully enters, there would be a page showing either one faction or a few. Upon clicking on a faction there would be three tabs dedicated to the units, or buildings, or support powers said faction utilizes.

## Why
This website exists for two reasons: 
#1. It is designed to show to game companies of my affinity for video game related products, especially in matters of website development.
#2. It also exists to assit individual gamers regarding the ways of developing tactics by providing accurate information regarding the nature of the units of specific factions in this hypothetical game.
