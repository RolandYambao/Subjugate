# Project 2 Idea #2: Questionable Job Board
This project is a database containing an questionable set of jobs available for prospective employees. This job board appears quite questionable as part of its aesthetic design, but it will maybe contain real job information from other sites. It will also contain a variety of fake jobs that create and aura of strangeness that would make it interesting to visualize and design.

## Who
This project is designed for prospective employees seeking jobs or perhaps to recruitment agencies seeking ways to better recruit more employees.

## What
Upon entering the website, there is a login requirement, once one successfully enters, there would be a page showing a large amounts of open jobs. There would be a search bar at the top right that can help reduce what you see in the screen based on select keywords.

## Why
This website exists to help organize large amounts of data into something that can be easily regulated with keywords in a way that is useful for many today while also being somewhat entertaining to read.

### Note: This idea is similar to Idea #3: Strange Online Market, but with different aesthetic themes.
