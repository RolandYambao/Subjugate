# Project 2 Idea #3: Strange Online Market
This project is a database containing a strange set of items available for unwitting customers. This strange online market will contain a variety of odd products with unusual descriptions and perhaps some real world products as well. 

## Who
This project is designed for shoppers interested in buying a variety of bizarre contraptions. It is also for companies who design e-commerce sites regarding the methods of organizing the marketplace.

## What
Upon entering the website, there is a login requirement, once one successfully enters, there would be a page showing a large amounts of strange objects for sale. There would be a search bar at the top right that can help reduce what you see in the screen based on select keywords.

## Why
This website exists to help organize large amounts of data into something that can be easily regulated with keywords in a way that is useful for many today while also being somewhat entertaining to read.

### Note: This idea is similar to Idea #2: Questionable Job Board, but with different aesthetic themes.
